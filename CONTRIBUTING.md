## Merging PRs

This repo uses **Release Please** for automated versioning + releases.

To ensure Release Please can generate changelogs and future releases correctly, please prefer:
- **Squash merge** (recommended)

Avoid:
- "Create a merge commit" (it produces commit messages like `Merge pull request #123...` which Release Please can't parse for release notes).
